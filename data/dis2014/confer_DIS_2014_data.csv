In this paper, we present a series of small scale explorations of leather, first as skin close interfaces for physical engagement, and secondly in terms of crafting using hand tools and a laser cutter. We reflect on our experiences along these two strands and discuss future possibilities of leather as a rich material for providing new types of interactive experiences. By discussing emerging topics related to traditional crafting processes and contemporary rapid fabrication with this material, we find a great potential of merging such processes and tools for future interaction design settings.","Tsaknaki, Fernaeus, Schaub",11,Craft,6.23.2014,10:50,FALSE,TRUE1102,Sewing Interest in E-Textiles: Analyzing Making from a Gendered Perspective,"In this paper we explore the appropriateness of e-textiles for teaching programming to mixed gender groups ages 8-12, allowing children to construct maker identities around technology.

This creates a need to understand the broader use of video chat that moves –beyond talking heads.” In this paper, we investigate one emergent scenario: major life events where video chat is used to connect remote participants to a ritual gathering (e.g., a wedding, a funeral). To explore this scenario, we conducted an online survey with 87 people who reported on their usage of video chat for viewing or sharing major life events. Our results show that major life events, as an example of a burgeoning set of video chat scenarios, bring unique socio-technical contexts and challenges. Asymmetry characterized much of the findings: we find differences between local and remote group sizes, environments, atmosphere, and emotionality. We discuss these situations and identify ways to improve the design of video chat to better support shared experiences.","Massimi, Neustaedter",12,Domestic Life,6.23.2014,10:50,FALSE,FALSE1202,Domestic Appropriations of Tokens to the Web ,"We present findings from a study of Tokens of Search, a system comprising physical RFID •tokensê that point to web content, and a wooden tray fixed to a small screen, which can be used to access that content.

How can we explain and teach how criticality can be applied to design? How can we assess, compare and give context to critical designs? How should we understand the relationships among practices that bear affinities to critical design, such as speculative design or critical engineering? We argue that many of these issues would be clarified if the HCI and design research communities had a collection of examples that exemplified not just critical design in general, but also its major genres, styles, historical trends, rhetorics, and other distinctions. As a first step in this direction, we detail our efforts to develop a more systematic vocabulary to talk about critical design. After assembling a small operative corpus from a wider inventory of critical designs, we apply poststructuralist semiotic theory to propose a number of analytic distinctions and concepts that could be usedãalong with others like themãto more systematically and deliberately construct a canon of exemplars and a more mature conceptual vocabulary for critical design.","Ferri, Bardzell, Bardzell, Louraine",21,Critical Design,6.24.2014,10:50,FALSE,FALSE2102,PKI: Crafting Critical Design,"In this paper we discuss the value of an open, responsive research structure in the context of a multi faceted, critical design project that has participation at its core.

Such displays enhance workspace awareness: when a person is working on one side of a transparent display, the person on the other side can see the otherês body, hand gestures, gaze and what he or she is actually manipulating on the shared screen. Even so, we argue that designing such transparent displays must go beyond current offerings if it is to support collaboration. First, both sides of the display must accept interactive input, preferably by at least touch and / or pen, as that affords the ability for either person to directly interact with the workspace items. Second, and more controversially, both sides of the display must be able to present different content, albeit selectively. Third (and related to the second point), because screen contents and lighting can partially obscure what can be seen through the surface, the display should visually enhance the actions of the person on the other side to better support workspace awareness.

We present PianoText, a computationally designed mapping that assigns letter sequences of English to frequent note transitions of music. It allows fast text entry on any MIDI-enabled keyboard and was evaluated in two transcription typing studies. Both show an achievable rate of over 80 words per minute. This parallels the rates of expert Qwerty typists and doubles that of a previous piano-based design from the 19th century. We also design PianoText-Mini, which allows for comparable performance in a portable form factor. Informed by the studies, we estimate the upper bound of typing performance, draw implications to other text entry methods, and critically discuss outstanding design challenges.?","Feit, Oulasvirta",39,Perfoming Interactions,6.25.2014,15:20,FALSE,FALSE3902,Practicing Somaesthetics: Exploring Its Impact on Interactive Product Design Ideation,"Somaesthetics has been adapted as a theoretical foundation for explaining the aesthetic experience of interaction. However, the practice of somaesthetics remains relatively unexplored in HCI, and it has potential to improve the ideation process of interactive product design by improving designers and developersê sensibility of haptic, dynamic, and invisible qualities of movements. We introduce somaesthetic reflection, a somatic introspection method in pragmatic somaesthetics, and explore its impact on the ideation through a practical workshop. This study revealed that somaesthetic reflection helps the participants experience and recognize unconscious movements and coordination of movements, which further contributes to discovery of design issues in the ideation, and more effective experience prototyping of interaction with moving products. The characteristics of the design approaches found in this study are discussed.","Lee, Lim, Shusterman",39,Perfoming Interactions,6.25.2014,15:20,FALSE,FALSE3903,Human Actions Made Tangible: Analysing the Temporal Organization of Activities,"With designers increasingly moving beyond button pushing and flat-screen interaction towards tangible and embodied interaction, techniques for user studies need to develop as well. While ethnographic video studies and ethnomethodological analyses are becoming standard in many interaction design projects, it remains a challenge to investigate in detail how people interact with all of their body. Analysis of full-body movement is time consuming, notation techniques are rare, and findings are difficult to share between members of a design team. In this paper we propose tangible video analysis, a method developed to engage people from different backgrounds in collaboratively analyzing videos with the help of physical objects. We will present one of these tools, Action Scrabble, for analyzing temporal organization of human actions. We work with a case of skilled forklift truck driving. By backtracking our design research experiments, we will unfold how and why the tangible tool succeeds in engaging designers with varied analysis experience to collaboratively focus on human action structures _ and even find video analysis fun!","Buur, Caglio,  Jensen",39,Perfoming Interactions,6.25.2014,15:20,FALSE,FALSE3904,The Uncanny Valley of Embodied Interaction Design (Note),"The 'Uncanny Valley' theory explains the counter-intuitive phenomenon where people may get suddenly uncomfortable with an artificial entity when it becomes very similar to humans. We propose the existence of an –uncanny valley” for embodied interaction, when a userês body motions in the physical space (the locus of interaction) are incompletely mapped into effects in the virtual space (the focus of interaction). It is generally assumed that this mapping should be as veridical as possible to promote seamless embodied interaction. Many design factors (e.g., synchronicity, sensitivity, shared realism) contribute to veridical locus-focus mapping. We intentionally varied the level of veridicality of these different factors, affecting how the userês movements were mapped to virtual effects. Our results indicate that there is a dip (valley) in user preferences when the design contains mixed degrees of veridicality. Thus, when one veridical dimension is limited, designers should likewise reduce the veridicality of other dimensions.","Cafaro, Lyons, Roberts, Radinsky",39,Perfoming Interactions,6.25.2014,15:20,FALSE,FALSE3905,Vocalizing Dance Movement for Interactive Sonification of Laban Effort Factors (Note),"We investigate the use of interactive sound feedback for dance pedagogy based on the practice of vocalizing while moving. Our goal is to allow dancers to access a greater range of expressive movement qualities through vocalization. We propose a methodology for the sonification of Effort Factors, as defined in Laban Movement Analysis, based on vocalizations performed by movement experts. Based on the experiential outcomes of an exploratory workshop, we propose a set of design guidelines that can be applied to interactive sonification systems for learning to perform Laban Effort Factors in a dance pedagogy context.","Francoise, Fdili Alaoui, Schiphorst, Bevilacqua",39,Perfoming Interactions,6.25.2014,15:20,FALSE,FALSE700,Design Jam & welcome reception,Design Jam & welcome reception,Vancouver Design Nerds,700,Design Jam & welcome reception,6.22.2014,18:30,FALSE,FALSE710,Plenary,Opening Plenary,Peter Paul Verbeek,710,Plenary,6.23.2014,9:00,FALSE,FALSE720,Special Program Panel,"Honoring Protocol: Design by, for and with Aboriginal Peoples",,720,Special Program Panel,6.24.2014,9:00,FALSE,FALSE730,Plenary,Closing Plenary,Janet Moore and Duane Elervum/CityStudio of Vancouver,730,Plenary,6.25.2014,15:20,FALSE,FALSE
