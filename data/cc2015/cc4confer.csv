In this research we took the approach of involving blind and visually impaired people, from a range of ages, in a hands-on making activity using an eTextile physical computing toolkit. Our aim was to create an environment where people could both make and learn form each other, but also where they would share their thoughts and imagine future scenarios for the technologies they were developing. We observed highly creative ways of working at all levels, from unique weaving techniques to choices in fabrics and materials, as well as expressions of personal preferences. We discuss the _ÑÉin-home enjoyment_Ñé scenarios sketched by the participants and point to the role of creative workshops and eTextile toolkits as a tool for imagining future technologies.

Different to other types of performance, theatre costumes are secondary to acting. Our investigations are based on two practice-based case studies: a self-directed design research within a student project, and a collaboration with a local theatre house, where interactive costume elements were developed in a real-life setting. These reveal requirements and challenges for the design process as well as the effective staging of interactive costumes, the biggest challenge being how to integrate these into existing structures of traditional theatre houses, and requirements for the costumes themselves. Because interactive costumes integrate technological features and traditional analogue crafts, they require interdisciplinary collaboration and transcend established boundaries between departments in theatre houses, challenging established work processes and structures."4,CCp136,6/22/15,11:00,12:30,3,2,1,Textiles and Objects,The Textility of Emotion: A Study Relating Computational Textile Textural Expression to Emotion,paper,Felecia Davis,"Pennsylvania State University, University Park PA, USA","Computational textiles are textiles that respond to computer programming commands through embedded electronics. The purpose of this study is to determine what still and shape-changing, textural expressions of computational textiles can communicate emotionally to people. The central hypothesis is that for both kinds of textiles, there will be differences depending on whether the study participants experience the textiles via vision alone or via both vision and touch.  \  \ If designers could begin to understand the nature of what various textile expressions communicated, and what computational textiles communicated in transformation then it would be possible to more clearly understand the role that texture of a computational textile plays in communicating emotion through a computational object. \  \  \ "5,CCp185,6/22/15,11:00,12:30,4,2,1,Textiles and Objects,Intersecting with Unaware Objects,paper,"William Odom, Ron Wakkary","Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada","We adopt a design-oriented approach aimed at motivating and expanding the notion of everyday creativity beyond explicit interactions or purposed manipulations to also include the implicit, incremental and, at times even, unknowing encounters that emerge among people, technologies, and artifacts over time. Specifically, we explore these ideas through the design and investigation of two interaction design research artifacts: the Photobox and table-non-table. Through analyzing and synthesizing insights that emerged across our studies, we describe a related set of concepts in support of a more implicit form of everyday creativity, which include: unaware objects, intersections and ensembles. We conclude by interpreting findings in context of prior implications for everyday creativity and outline considerations for future work."6,CCp219,6/22/15,13:30,15:00,5,3,2,Tools and Interfaces,Building Support Tools to Connect Novice Designers with Professional Coaches,paper,"Daniel Rees Lewis, Emily Harburg, Elizabeth Gerber, Matthew Easterday","Northwestern University , Evanston, Illinois, United States","Creativity support tools help learners undertake creative work, such as facilitating coaching by creative professionals. How might we design creativity support tools that in-crease learners_Ñé access to coaching by creative professionals? This study took place in an extracurricular project-based learning program where students were co-located, and met professional coaches face-to-face once a week but otherwise communicated online. To test an online creativity support tool called the Loft and investigate coach-student communication we collected data from 47 interviews, online log data and field observations. We found that (a) explicit help-seeking was rare outside of meetings, (b) help from professionals was highly-valued but not sought out, and (c) online systems could surface learner struggles and trigger help-giving.  Our findings suggested that online creativity platforms can support professional coaching through: (1) structured virtual updates (2) coach thanking, (3) Computer-Supported Group Critique, (4) disclosure of expertise, and (5) help-seeking training.

We conducted a mixed methods crowdsourced study, with data from 54 participants, amidst the 2014 Academy Awards. Quantitative and qualitative findings validate the technique of in-context exploratory browsing interfaces for social media. Their consistency supports the validity of ideation metrics of exploratory browsing as an evaluation methodology for interactive systems designed to promote creative engagement."8,CCp167,6/22/15,13:30,15:00,7,3,2,Tools and Interfaces,You_Ñére the Voice: Evaluating User Interfaces for Encouraging Underserved Youths to express themselves through Creative Writing,paper,"Frederica GonÕ_alves, Pedro Campos, Julian Hanna, Simone Ashby","Madeira-ITI, Funchal Madeira, Portugal","Minority groups are the fastest growing demographic in the U.S. In addition, the poverty level in the U.S. is the highest it has been in the last 50 years. We argue that the community needs more research addressing this user segment, and we present a novel study about how underserved youths react when presented with different UI designs aimed at promoting creative writing. The act of creative writing per se can become the driver of change among underserved teenagers, and researchers should strive to discover novel UI designs that can effectively increase this target group_Ñés productivity, creativity and mental well-being. Using MS Word as baseline, our contribution analyzes the influence of a Zen-like tool (designed by the authors and called Haven), a nostalgic but realistic typewriting tool (Hanx Writer), and a stress-based tool that eliminates writer_Ñés block by providing consequences for procrastination (Write or Die). Our results suggest that the Zen characteristics of our tool Haven were capable of conveying a sense of calm and concentration to the users, making them feel better and also write more. The nostalgic Hanx typewriter also fared very well with regard to mental well-being and productivity, as measured by average number of words written. Contrary to our initial expectations, the stress-based UI (Write or Die) had the lowest productivity levels."9,CCp147,6/22/15,13:30,15:00,8,3,2,Tools and Interfaces,MetaMorphe: Designing Expressive 3D Models for Digital Fabrication,paper,"Cesar Torres, Eric Paulos","EECS, UC Berkeley, Berkeley California, USA","The creative promise of 3D digital fabrication tools is tremendous. However due to the wide range of tools and interfaces, a common static file format called STL is used for sharing designs. While customization tools add creative handles to these digital models, they are often constrained to pre-configured parameters limiting the creative potential of shared digital models. We introduce MetaMorphe, a novel digital fabrication framework that uses a common web-programming metaphor to enable users to easily transform static 3D models into re-formed, re-made, and re-imagined customized personal artifacts. We demonstrate the compatibility of MetaMorphe with three well-established design interfaces, direction manipulation, scripted-CAD, and generative design. Through a user study with design experts, MetaMorphe reveals that decisions that physically produce bespoke artifacts or encode unique metadata actively affect perceptions of authorship, agency, and authenticity. We discuss how expressive model-building tools such as MetaMorphe enable a cultural shift in 3D design in terms of participation, personalization, and creativity."10,CCp131,6/22/15,15:30,17:00,9,4,3,Finding Inspriation,Providing Timely Examples Improves the Quantity and Quality of Generated Ideas,paper,"Pao Siangliulue, Joel Chan, Krzysztof Gajos, Steven Dow","SEAS, Harvard University, Cambridge Massachusetts, United States","Emerging online ideation platforms with thousands of example ideas provide an important resource for creative production. But how can ideators best use these examples to create new innovations? Recent work has suggested that not just the choice of examples, but also the timing of their delivery can impact creative outcomes. Building on existing cognitive theories of creative insight, we hypothesize that people are likely to benefit from examples when they run out of ideas. We explore two example delivery mechanisms that test this hypothesis: 1) a system that proactively provides examples when a user appears to have run out of ideas, and 2) a system that provides examples when a user explicitly requests them. Our online experiment (N=97) compared these two mechanisms against two baselines: providing no examples and automatically showing examples at a regular interval. Participants who requested examples themselves generated ideas that were rated the most novel by external evaluators. Participants who received ideas automatically when they appeared to be stuck produced the most ideas. Importantly, participants who received examples at a regular interval generated fewer ideas than participants who received no examples, suggesting that mere access to examples is not sufficient for creative inspiration. These results emphasize the importance of the timing of  example delivery. Insights from this study can inform the design of collective ideation support systems that help people generate many high quality ideas."11,CCp129,6/22/15,15:30,17:00,10,4,3,Finding Inspriation,InkWell: A Creative Writer's Creative Assistant,paper,"Richard P.

These verbalizations are segmented in order to enable a quantifiable analysis of the cognitive processes. Researchers have shown how Shannonäó»s entropy can be applied to coded verbal data to provide a measure of creativity of those processes. We applied this method to a pilot study, investigating the effects of different design tools on creativity in the context of architectural design. Participants had to design three tasks of isomorphic nature, each with a different tool, in one design session. As shown a significant number of verbal comments were repetitions of already established ideas. Such comments brought nothing new to the sequence of activities but affected the value of information carried within that process which biased the measure of creativity. The paper regards these utterance as verbal noise. It proposes the use of corpus linguistic tools together with a coding scheme that can depict the hierarchical relationship of cognitive patterns used in the process to eliminate verbal noise from analysis. The method was applied to one participantäó»s data, which shows a promising step in increasing the veracity of using verbal data in analyzing cognitive activity.
